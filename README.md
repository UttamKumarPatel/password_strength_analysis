## Data Collection

The data is collected from a SQLite database named `password_Data.sqlite`. The database contains user passwords which are used for analysis and prediction.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning steps include:
- Removing unnecessary columns.
- Handling missing values.
- Ensuring data consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is performed to understand the distribution and key patterns in the data. Libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are used for visualization.

## Model Training

A logistic regression model is trained to predict the strength of passwords. The steps involved are:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Vectorizing the text data using `TfidfVectorizer`.
- Training the model using `scikit-learn`.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using various metrics such as:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
